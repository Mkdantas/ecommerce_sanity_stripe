**Practice application to help me learn nextJs, sanity as a headless CRM and stripe as a payment method.**. Modern design, animations, the ability to add and edit products on the go using a CMS, all advanced cart functionalities, and most importantly the complete integration with Stripe so that you can cover REAL payments.

In this project i learned:
- Advanced React Best Practices such as
    - Folder and file structure, hooks and refs
- Advanced State Management of the entire application using React Context API
- Next.js Best Practices such as
    - File-based routing, Data fetching that allows server-side rendering and static generation which makes your websites incredibly optimized (show getServerSideProps, getStaticPaths, getStaticProps), and you’ll also learn how to use Next.js as a backend endpoint.
- how to integrate Stripe to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process
- And most importantly how to manage the entire content of your app using Sanity. Sanity is the unified content platform that’ll make the making of our entire app possible. <show sanity desk>
